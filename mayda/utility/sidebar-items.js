Similar to but less convenient than `Index`. `Index::index()` returns a reference, but an encoded vector type must give ownership of the returned value to the caller."],["AccessInto","A trait for indexing a range of an encoded vector. Writes the result into the slice provided. Similar to but less convenient than `Index`."],["Bits","Indicates that the bitwise representation of the type is known to `mayda`.
